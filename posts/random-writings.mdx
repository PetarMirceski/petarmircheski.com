# A Year of Transformation: Reflecting on New Beginnings

It has been more than a year since I last updated this blog. 
So much has changed in that time! I have had some changes in my personal life and academia and even took on some exciting collaborative projects. 
I want to share a candid review of the past year, a time filled with challenges, growth, and unexpected adventures.

## A New Me

One of the milestones I am most proud of is the 30 kg weight loss. 
This journey was not just about shedding kilograms it was about gaining a healthier mindset and new energy for life.  

- **The Beginning:** It started with a simple decision to prioritize my health, which led to a series of small changes that led to a significant transformation.
- **Quitting:** I managed to give up drinking alcohol, which was a huge step towards a healthier lifestyle.
- **The Process:** After quitting drinking alcohol, I researched and decided to take small steps such as trying out intermittent fasting and trying to achieve some daily step goals.  
- **Running:** I started running, which not only helped with weight loss but also became a huge energy outlet for me, allowing me to clear my mind and focus on the present.
- **Mindset Transformation:** With each kilogram lost, I felt much freer both mentally and physically.
- **The next step:** I am now working on quitting smoking. Smoking is truly a nasty habit that keeps oneself shackled to addiction.

## PhD studies  

In 2024 I decided to continue my studies at Tokyo Institute of Technology.
To be honest, the experience so far feels more like a continuation of my master's program than the dramatic turning point I expected. 
It is just another part of my daily routine.
Over the past year, I managed to write a manuscript titled [Spatial locking of chimera states to frequency heterogeneity in nonlocally coupled oscillators
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02881) and attended the International Conference on Self-organization in Life and Matter conference at Meiji University in Tokyo.
On top of that, I also managed to apply for two more conferences, Dynamics Days in Greece and Nolta in Okinawa later this year.

## Project: Building a Website

In early 2024, I took part in a project to create a website for a private psychology practice. 
Our initial approach was a quick launch using WordPress—a simple, rough version that effectively jump-started the venture. 
While it served its immediate purpose, it quickly became clear that the site had significant room for improvement.

Recognizing the need for a more robust solution, we rebuilt the website using Next.js. 
The transformation was striking: the new site now boasts a sleek design, enhanced functionality, and a user-friendly interface, while being much more professional.

- **Project Evolution:**  
  - **Initial Approach:** A basic WordPress site that got the practice off the ground.  
  - **Next.js Upgrade:** Transitioning to Next.js unlocked modern design features, improved performance, and also is internationalized in both English and Japanese, resulting in a far superior user experience.

## Looking Back
Reflecting on the past year, I've come to appreciate slower but steadier progress. 
It has been a year of subtle, cumulative improvements that make a big difference.
