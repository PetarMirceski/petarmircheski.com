# Introduction

In my native language there is a fequently asked question that roughly translates to "What do you do?" in English.

When asking this question, people are usually asking about my job, or affiliation to an organization.
I used to work as a software engineer for a few years, but I never got comfortable with calling myself a "Programmer".

My current position as a PhD candidate at Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan is at the department of systems and control.
The first thought that comes to mind when I say that, is that they always think that I either work with robots or something related to control systems, which is also not true.

I work with a field called "Complex Networks" which is a field that studies the behavior of networks of interconnected systems.
But people usually don't understand what that means, so I usually say that I work with "Patterns" and draw nice looking figures.

# Chimera States

Some equations produce patterns that are not uniform, but rather a mix of different patterns.
For example, the Kuramoto model is a system of coupled oscillators that can produce a pattern called a "Chimera State".

$
\dot{\theta}(x, t) = \omega(x) + \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} G(x-x') \sin(\theta(x', t) - \theta(x, t) - \alpha) d x'.
