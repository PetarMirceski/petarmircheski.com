# Obtaining the *license*

Soooo, I got a Japanese driving license.
I already have a Macedonian driver's license, but because Macedonia is not part of the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic of 1968, I couldn't drive in Japan, even with an international drivers license issued in my country.
There are a few ways of obtaining a Japanese driving license.
One of them is through a transfer of your old driving license to a Japanese one, which I was did.
Be aware, this process is extremely tedious and it required me to almost 7 full days to obtain it.

## Documents

In order to apply for the transfer process I had to obtain all of the following documents:

* Passport.
* Translation of the old driver's license: This can be done online through a service provided by [JAF](https://jafnavi.jp/honyaku/uketuke/).
* A color photograph (2.4 x 3 cm): Typically taken at a photo booth.
* Residence permit: Obtainable at your local city ward office or by your My Number Card at a convenience store.
* Self-written Duration of Stay Statement: A document detailing your length of stay in the country where your original license was issued (see example [document](https://www.keishicho.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/multilingual/english/traffic_safety/drivers_licenses/index.files/english.pdf)).

After obtaining all of the above mentioned documents you can proceed to go to your local driving examination center.
There are two driving license centers in which you can do the procedure.
One is the Samezu driving license center, while the other one is the Fuchuu driving license center.
In my case I choose the Samezu driving license center.

This guide will in detail explain the procedure, from initial application till obtaining the driving license.

## Initial application (Beginning of the headache)

At the time of my application, the Japanese government limited the number of applicants per day at each center. 
For example, the Samezu center accepted roughly 30 candidates and began registration at 8:30 a.m. 
My first attempt, arriving at 9:00 a.m., was unsuccessful, I was met with a closed counter and a notice that registration for the day had already finished. 
My second attempt at 7:00 a.m. the following day also ended in disappointment, as I couldn’t secure a spot in line. 
On my third try, I took the first train to the center, and patiently waited outside from 6:40 until 8:30, and finally had my documents accepted.

After the initial document processing, I was instructed to return around 1:00 p.m. to complete the next steps, which included:
    
* Enduring long, frustrating waiting times.
* A detailed interview, during which I was questioned about my experience obtaining my Macedonian license—including training hours, which side of the road is driven on in Macedonia, and details about the domestic exam.
* An eye test.
* Payment of processing fees and the eye test charge.
* A theoretical test in English consisting of 10 questions.
* Scheduling a reservation for the practical driving exam.

## Initial test (a failure)

Since this was my first time driving on the left side of the road and taking a test designed for an automatic car (which I never haven driven one), I enrolled for a class with [EDS International Driving School](https://www.eds-jp.com/service-page/practice-drive-gaimen-kirikae-100-min?referral=service_list_widget).
The class was very well organized, the instructor spoke excellent English, and covered the practical exam process, explaining the details regarding the exam.

Some key points to look out for in the exam are:

* Looking under the car before the practical exam starts.
* 3 points safety checks, in which one should check the back mirror, look at a side view mirror and then look over the shoulder before changing lanes (the instructor should be very aware of this).
* 5 point safety checks, before starting to drive and when stoppoing in which all of the side view mirrors, back mirror and both shoulder checks.
* Proper car positioning turning, in such a way that one prevents the passage of

However, not all my experiences were positive.
On the exam day I was told to enter the car directly, and when I asked the officer whether the initial safety checks were necessary, 
I encountered an extremely rude police officer, who shouted at me instead of giving a strightforward answer.
This in turn only stress me out additionally, which resulted in me failing the exam, which I had to reschedule again.
The next availabled test date was 4 months away.

## Second attemps 

I was determined not to let my previous failuare end my pursuit of obtaining the license. 
I began calling the center repeatedly. 
After many call, I was fortunately able to secure an earlier appointment only 1 months later.
On my second attempt, I was fortunate the first candidate to take the test, which set the stage for a smooth experience. 
With the pressure eased, I managed to pass the practical exam without any complications.
Following the successful test, I continued with the remaining procedures. 
Over the course of just four additional hours, on the same day, filling out more documents, completing the final procedural steps, and taking the required photos I received my Japanese driving license.


## Conclusion

After my first stressful attempt ended in failure and a long wait for a new test date, my second try went smoothly. 
I was the first candidate of the day, and the quick final steps allowed me to get my license within a few hours. 
If you're considering this procedure, be ready for a long and frustraiting journey, but remember that being persistant with your goals can lead to success.
