# Atami

Located in Shizuoka Prefecture, Atami makes for a great day trip destination.
Around two hours away from Tokyo by the JR train lines, Atami serves as a
popular travel destination for more that 6 million Japanese tourists every year.
Atami's hot spring fame is a reference to its name, which means "hot ocean".
Being located on a steep hill, viewing the city from one of it's beaches
gives Atami more to it's charm and grandiose.

# Winter Sakura

The sakura in Atami are among the earliest cherry blossoms to bloom in Japan. While
in Japan cherry blossom season starts in March, in Atami you can enjoy the fully bloomed
sakura in early February.

The street along the small Itogawa River is about a 10-minute walk down from
Atami Station. You can see the sakura planted on either side along the street,
making for a lovely short walk. There are several small bridges along the river
that serve as great areas to take some nice pictures.
