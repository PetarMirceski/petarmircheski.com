As we welcome another new year, I find myself reflecting on the past and looking
forward to the future. I have a lot on my plate - but I wouldn't have it any
other way. My love for programming, studying, and travel is what drives me
forward and gives me the energy to tackle each day.

This year, I have made several resolutions that I hope will help me reach new
heights in my personal and professional life.

I want to focus on my studies and make the most of my time at the Tokyo
Institute of Technology. Last year I managed to do a fair but of research as
part of my studies and I had the opportunity to present my research at several
conferences and workshops. I want to challenge myself to broaden my horizons
through research and collaboration.

I want to explore more of the world and experience new cultures. Travel
has always been a passion of mine, and I want to visit at least one new country
this year. I believe that travel is one of the best ways to broaden your
perspective and gain a deeper appreciation for the world around us.

I'm excited to embark on this journey and see where it takes me. I know it won't
always be easy, but I am confident that with hard work and determination, I will
be able to achieve my goals and live a fulfilling life.

Here's to a happy, healthy, and successful 2023!
