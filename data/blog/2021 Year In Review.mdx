2021 was arguably my most turbulent year of my life.
Overall, **I met 90% of my goals**.

### Highlights

- Got the MEXT Scholarship
- Traveled to Tokyo
- Started this blog
- Had fun
- Made new friends
- Became happier

### Personal

Hands down, my biggest life even this year was moving to Tokyo and being a research student at
Tokyo Institute of Technology. It was hard moving away from friends and family but during
my two month's of stay I think I have caught on how living along works.

I am currently living in a dorm with a lot of interesting guys. I also met all of the other
students from the intensive Japanese language course that I am currently taking, I enjoy
having dinner and drinks with them.

### Professional

At the start of 2021, I was getting accustomed to my new role as React developer at Aritmatrix.
While I had never learned web-development because of my knowledge in Linear Algebra I had
to settle and learn how javascript, web-frameworks and general front-end development
in a short amount of time. Coming from a machine-learning engineering and research background
the switch to being a front-end engineer was a refreshing experience.

Luckily, I enjoyed learning and was up for a challenge.
Thanks to my great teammates I learned more that I did in the last few years in a few months.
Thanks to the support of my teammates I learned the following stacks and technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Material-UI](https://mui.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

This knowledge and experience led to other endeavors such as doing this blog.

### Goals for 2022

This year I think is going to get more challenging with time since I will be
starting my masters studies from April.
But my incomplete goal list is:

- Study hard
- Do well in my masters.
- Travel.
- Write a research paper.
- Have fun.
- Write more blog posts.
- Focus on my diet.
