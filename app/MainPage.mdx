# About Me

I am a Macedonian graduate student at Tokyo Institute of Technology majoring in the Department of Systems and Control Engineering, School of Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan. My academic advisor is Prof. Dr. Nakao Hiroya. I have a knack for problem solving. You can find my CV <Link className="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300" href="/cv.pdf">here.</Link>

## Interests

I have a deep-seated passion for delving into the topic of nonlinear dynamics and control engineering. I have been fortunate to immerse myself in a variety of captivating topics, including Reduction Methods, Synchronization, Nonlinear System Analysis, Chaos Theory and Networked Dynamics. These explorations have equipped me with a solid foundation in the realms of systems engineering while nurturing my fascination for intricate dynamics and their real-world applications.

I love learning languages, I am fluent in Macedonian and English, and I have some efficiency in Serbo-Croatian. I am currently engrossed in mastering Japanese. My linguistic journey has not only enabled me to bridge cultural gaps but has also kindled my curiosity for understanding diverse societies.

When I am not doing research or at the lab I tweek with my dot-files, program, tweek electronics or stroll through Akihabara to find dirt cheap electronics and garbage that I like tweaking with. I also sometimes write blog posts on this website.

I generally don't use social media so the only way to track what I do is to either look up this website or message me at <EmailReveal />
